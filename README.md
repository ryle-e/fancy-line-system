# Fancy Lines for Unity v0.1

## NOTE: Requires [NaughtyAttributes]( to be installed in order to work

A package developed for use in Unity that allows for complex and quality usages of LineRenderers, including curves, spirals, helixes, waves, and more!

This package currently only supports lines that go between two points and displacement on those points, NOT bezier curves (yet- they'll be added soon :) )
